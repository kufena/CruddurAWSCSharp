## Cruddur but in C#

This is a repository for a version of Cruddur, written in C#.

Cruddur is a tool written by Andrew Brown, which forms part of the process of learning about AWS in the real world, through his AWS Boot Camp.  I started (and may complete) this boot camp, but have fallen behind and decided the best way to catch up was to rewrite it using technologies I know.  I may steal the front end though, I'm not sure yet.
